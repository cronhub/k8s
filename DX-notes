*****
A Kubernetes Service that identifies a set of Pods using label selectors. Unless mentioned otherwise,
Services are assumed to have virtual IPs only routable within the cluster network.

Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster.
 Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.

An Ingress can be configured to give Services externally-reachable URLs, load balance traffic, terminate SSL / TLS, and offer name based virtual hosting. An Ingress controller is responsible for fulfilling the Ingress,
 usually with a load balancer, though it may also configure your edge router or additional frontends to help handle the traffic.
